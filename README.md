A 2048 variant with voice support.
Works only on browsers with support for the Web Speech API, which is at the time of writing only Google Chrome.

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](https://yellowjello.github.io/2048-voice/)

This is a fork of [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048/)

This uses a version of the [annyang](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang) voice command library, modified by me to remove a lot of features to make detection of single word commands faster.
